RUNNING ON LINUX
================
Here the several folders contain the seperate minor projects.
Each folder contains the source code as well as the executable binary file.
For Example the folder project contains the source code project.cpp as well as the executable file project.
The folder lib does not contain any project but header files required in several projects.
Suppose this graphics folder is located in your path FOLDER then 
for running a project say bezier_curve type in command-line
$ cd FOLDER/bezier_curve
$ ./bezier

and the program should run.
If it quotes the error in loading shared library it may be due to the fact that your machine is running some different version
of OpenGL or any other cause.
Try compliling it as follows.
For example the bezier.cpp source file includes custom header files matrix.cpp and point.cpp which are located in the path FOLDER/lib.
so you may compile it as
$ g++ bezier.cpp ../lib/point.cpp ../lib/matrix.cpp -lglut -lGLU .
This will generate an a.out file which can be run conveniently as 
$ ./a.out

The file inbezier serves as input for the bezier curve.
You may modify it but may need to consider the constraints.
